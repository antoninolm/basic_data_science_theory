    "# Introduction to Classes\n",
    "Classes in Python are not just a technical construct; they represent a way of thinking about programs. Instead of dealing with scattered pieces of data and functions, classes bring both together into a unified structure. They allow us to model the world in a more human-like way: we don’t just think of numbers and strings, but of students, employees, or circles, each with their own identity and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is essentially a blueprint. On its own, it does nothing—it simply describes what an object should look like and how it should behave. When we instantiate a class, we create an object, a living instance that holds actual data. This distinction is important: the class defines possibilities, while the object represents reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main kinds of variables in this system. Class variables are shared across all objects. For example, every grade at a school might share the same definition of what “passing” means. Instance variables, on the other hand, belong only to individual objects. Roger and Sandro may both be students, but their names, years, and grades differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior in classes is expressed through methods. These are functions tied to objects, always starting with the invisible companion, self. This little keyword represents the object itself, ensuring that methods act on the right data. A circle doesn’t just store its radius—it knows how to calculate its own area and circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor—the __init__ method—gives shape to new objects at the very moment they are created. It decides what data must be supplied and ensures that every object begins its life in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, Python provides special methods like __repr__ to define how objects present themselves. Instead of cryptic memory addresses, we can ask objects to speak in human terms: a circle can tell us its radius, a student can reveal their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an important realization: everything in Python is an object. Numbers, strings, lists, even functions—all are instances of classes. This uniformity is what makes Python powerful. It means we can treat built-in types and our own classes in the same way, exploring their attributes and extending their capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, classes shift programming from manipulating raw data to shaping entities that carry both data and meaning. They encourage us to think less about operations in isolation, and more about the relationships between things—an approach that mirrors how we understand the real world."

    "## Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data is organized into different **types**, such as `int`, `float`, `list`, and `dict`. Each type defines what kind of data it can hold and what operations can be performed on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the type of a variable with the built-in `type()` function. For example, `\"Cool String\"` is of type `str` and `12` is of type `int`.\n",

    "The type of a variable dictates what operations are valid:\n",

    "## Introduction to Classes – Attribute Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both **class variables** and **instance variables** are considered **attributes** of an object.\n",
    "If you try to access an attribute that does not exist, Python raises an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NoCustomAttributes:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "attributeless = NoCustomAttributes()\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    attributeless.fake_attribute\n",
    "except AttributeError:\n",
    "    print(\"This text gets printed!\")\n",
    "# Output: This text gets printed!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid errors when we are not sure whether an attribute exists, Python provides two built-in functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`hasattr(object, \"attribute\")`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Returns `True` if the attribute exists, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`getattr(object, \"attribute\", default)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Returns the value of the attribute if it exists.\n",
    "  * If not, it returns the `default` value (if provided), instead of raising an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hasattr(attributeless, \"fake_attribute\")\n",
    "# False\n",
    "\n",
    "getattr(attributeless, \"other_fake_attribute\", 800)\n",
    "# 800\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attributes can be **checked** safely with `hasattr()`.\n",
    "* Attributes can be **retrieved** safely with `getattr()`, using a fallback default if needed.\n",
    "* These functions help avoid crashes when working with objects whose attributes you don’t fully control.\n"

    "## Modules – Python Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, reusability is essential. Instead of rewriting code for every new task, we organize and share functionality using **modules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **module** is a file (or a group of files, known as a **package**) that contains Python code intended to be reused.\n",
    "* Modules are often called **libraries** or **packages**, especially when they provide tools across many different scenarios.\n",
    "* To use a module, we import it into our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic import syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from module_name import object_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets us bring only the part we need from a library, instead of loading everything. Doing so avoids unnecessary overhead and prevents conflicts with existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the **datetime** module from the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `datetime` helps us work with dates and times.\n",
    "* It’s a good example of how modules provide prebuilt functionality that we can plug into our own programs.\n",

    "The **`random`** module is another widely used part of Python’s standard library. It provides tools to generate random numbers or make random selections, which is useful in simulations, games, data sampling, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `datetime`, where we only needed a single object, with `random` we often use multiple functions. That’s why the common practice is to import the whole module:\n",

    "import random\n",
    "```\n",

    "Two commonly used functions are:\n",

    "* **`random.choice(list)`** → takes a list and returns a random element from it.\n",
    "* **`random.randint(a, b)`** → generates a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list of numbers randomly generated between 1 and 100.\n",
    "2. Use `random.choice()` to select a random number from that list.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Modules in Python – Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, Python keeps its functions, classes, and variables inside a **namespace**. This prevents conflicts between your code and the module’s code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calling `random.randint()` means we are asking for the `randint` function inside the `random` module’s namespace.\n",
    "* Your file’s own code lives in the **local namespace**, separate from the module’s namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aliasing with `as`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes module names are long or clash with your local names. You can shorten or rename them when importing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name as alias\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you can type `plt.plot()` instead of the longer `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wildcard imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `from module import *` brings everything into the local namespace. This is discouraged because it can **pollute the namespace**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If two things share the same name (like a custom `floor()` function and `math.floor()`), Python won’t know which to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with `random.sample()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`random.sample()` allows you to select **k random elements** from a list or range.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sample_nums = random.sample(nums, 3)\n",

    "**Key takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Namespaces keep code organized and prevent naming conflicts.\n",
