# Introduction to Probability Portfolio Project

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores core concepts from an introductory probability course.  Each section includes a short theoretical description and a practical Python example.

## Contents
- `probability_intro.ipynb` – notebook with theory and code
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment (optional)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook probability_intro.ipynb
   ```

## Topics Covered
- Sample spaces and events
- Law of large numbers
- Addition and multiplication rules
- Bayes' theorem
- Binomial and Poisson distributions
- Expected value and variance
- Independence and conditional probability
- Random variables
- Combinatorics
- Cumulative distribution functions
- Normal distribution
